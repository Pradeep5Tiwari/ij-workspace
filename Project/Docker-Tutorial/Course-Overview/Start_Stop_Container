Start and Stop Container:-

Docker "run" command actually create a new container everytime. it does not reuse the container that we created previously.
which means since we executed docker run command couple of time then we should have couple of container on our computer.
However if we check using "docker ps" command we would see only running container. I don't see those container which we
have created and stopped but those containers actually still exist.

So if we do execute command:- "docker ps -a" --> This would give you the list of all containers whether they are running
or stopped. so there could be a container having different status like "Running" OR "Exited"

Note: You can remember a container by tis name than the id.


To give a specific name to the newly creating container using flag "--name container_name"
