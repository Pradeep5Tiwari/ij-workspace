Debugging Container:
1.docker logs container_id: If you want to see that what logs redis container is producing then this command would show
the logs.
OR
2. docker logs container_name: This would show the logs of container using container name.

Docker generate the random name to the containers but if you want to give your own name to these container then you
would have to execute the below command along with some extra switches.

example: docker run -d -p6001:6379 --name redis-older redis:4.0
         docker run -d -p6002:6379 --name redis-latest redis:6.0

Here --name switch would give a name "redis-older" to the container in which redis 4.0 is running.

Assume there is some problem with redis-latest container and
we want to get the terminal for this container OR
may be want to navigate inside the directory OR
check the log file OR
may be check the configuration file. OR
print out the environmental variable etc. So in order to do that we use the below command:
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash/ OR
docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash/

and once you run the above command you would see that cursor get changed. and we would be inside the container as root
user.
Note: In above command if container id is not recognize then enter container_name and it will work.

Example: terminal example

Note: The difference between "docker run" and "docker start" command.
"docker run" will start the images with new container where
"docker start" will start and stop the container or existing container.
