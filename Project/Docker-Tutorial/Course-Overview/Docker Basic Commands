Docker Basic Commands:

1. docker pull redis: It will download the redis docker image from docker hub. Initially it checks in local and if it does
                   not find then it will redirect to docker hub.

2. docker images: It will display the list of existing docker images in our machine.

3. docker run redis: After you have downloaded the redis image into your machine and now we want redis to be running so that my application
can connect to it. So I have to create the container of that redis images. That will make it possible to connect to the
redis application.

"docker run" This command will combine "pull" and "start" command.

4. docker ps: This command would list the running container.

5. docker run -d vsworkspace: This command would run the container in de-attached mode and it would create the new container
even if you have existing container. -d switch will run in de-attached mode and one hashcode id will be generated corresponding
to container.

6. docker stop container_id: This command will simply stop the container.
7. docker start container_id: This command will start the container.

8. docker ps -a: This command would lists the running and stopped container.
