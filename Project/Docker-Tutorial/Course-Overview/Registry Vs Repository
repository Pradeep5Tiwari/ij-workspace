Registry Vs Repository

Docker Registry:- A Service providing storage and can be hosted by third party, like AWS or by yourself.
                  Collection of repositories.

Docker Repository:- Collection of related images with same name but different versions.

Example: AWS ECR(Elastic Container Registry) is a registry so basically that's a service that provides storage for images
and inside that registry you can have multiple repositories for all your different application images so each application
gets repository its own and in that repository you can store different image versions or tags of the same application.
And in the same way. Docker hub is a registry its service for storing images and on docker hub you can have your public
repositories for storing images that will be accessible publicly. or you can have private repositories for different
applications and again you can have repository dedicated for each application.

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, share,
and deploy container images.
