Public and Private Registries:-

We have learnt about Docker Hub which is a Largest Public Registry which mean those images that we used are visible
and available for public but when company creates their own images of their own applications and of-course they don't
want it to be available publicly. So, for that there are private docker registries and there are many of them and almost
all cloud providers have service for private docker registry.

Example:
AWS ECR for Elastic Container Registry,
GCP, AZURE and all have their own docker registry.
Nexus - which is a popular artifact storage service has docker registry even Docker Hub has private Docker Registry.

You can create your own private/public docker registry and upload images there.
